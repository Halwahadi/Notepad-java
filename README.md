# Notepad-java
Create, retrieve, and delete notes.

Create a program which will allow the user to enter text that they wish to be stored, like digital Post-it notes. 
[The notes will be stored in a Linked List.] The user will have the option of entering a date which they want the 
post it to be affiliated with, functioning as a physical reminder would. The user will also have the option of 
prioritizing the note by making it “Urgent.” [Note information will be stored in an Array.] We will store the text
entries of the notes and let the user either search for the title of a Post-it note or search for a date affiliated 
with a Post-it note. If they search a title, the program will retrieve that specific Post-it note reminder. If they 
search for a date, the program will retrieve all Post-it note reminders affiliated with that date.
